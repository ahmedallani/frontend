Welcome to Djerba
Introduction
Djerba is an island in south Tunisia with beautiful sandy beaches and beautiful, peaceful and
silent
countryside. One from the best ecological destinations in the World, this island preserves its
traditions and its unique architectural theme.

Ras Rmel
Called the Flamingo or Pirates Island, this is a peninsula where flamingoes are present during
the
colder months starting in October. Ship cruises costing 20 DT per person for walk-ons (and about
40-45 DT per person for the hotel groups) are available at the Houmt Souk marina/port. The crews
are
energetic, passionate, and fun and the buffet lunch on the peninsula is wonderful. The package
runs
around 9AM to 3:30PM. There is loud dancing music on the boat, but the water is delightful and
the
trip is worth the price even for non-dancers.
